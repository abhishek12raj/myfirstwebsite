    A great friendship is irreplaceable — it can inspire you to grow into a better version of yourself. If you have a friend who motivates you, return the favor and be their number one cheerleader with one of these motivational friendship quotes.

“Friendship is the hardest thing in the world to explain. It’s not something you learn in school. But if you haven’t learned the meaning of friendship, you really haven’t learned anything.” — Muhammad Ali

“Don’t make friends who are comfortable to be with. Make friends who will force you to lever yourself up.” — Thomas J. Watson

“The most beautiful discovery true friends make is that they can grow separately without growing apart.” — Elisabeth Foley

“Each friend represents a world in us, a world possibly not born until they arrive, and it is only by this meeting that a new world is born.” — Anais Nin

“Life is partly what we make it, and partly what it is made by the friends we choose.” — Tennessee Williams

“They may forget what you said, but they will never forget how you made them feel.” — Carl W. Buechner

“Find a group of people who challenge and inspire you; spend a lot of time with them, and it will change your life.” — Amy Poehler

“For beautiful eyes, look for the good in others; for beautiful lips, speak only words of kindness; and for poise, walk with the knowledge that you are never alone.” — Audrey Hepburn

“The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched — they must be felt with the heart.” — Helen Keller

“Happiness can be found even in the darkest of times, if one only remembers to turn on the light.” — Dumbledore
